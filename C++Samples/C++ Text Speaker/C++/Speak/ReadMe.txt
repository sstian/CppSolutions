CTextSpeaker Class
------------------

The "core" speaking functionality is implemented in the CTextSpeaker class.
This class is defined in header file "TextSpeaker.h" (this class is designed
to be used also in non-MFC projects, as long as ATL is available; in fact,
some ATL helper classes like CComPtr are required).
